              Revetir offers free standard worldwide shipping for most orders, and expedited shipping to certain countries for an additional fee. Upon completing your order, an e-mail confirmation will be sent to your address on file. This e-mail will serve as an invoice and includes your order number. A standard processing time of up to five (5) business days is required before your order is shipped. Orders placed before 6:00 PM (Eastern Time) begin processing that day, and orders placed on weekends and holidays begin processing the following business day starting at 8:00 AM (Eastern Time). During peak periods, processing times may exceed 5 business days. Once your order has been shipped, you will receive an e-mail with your shipment's tracking information, allowing you to keep tabs on the progress of your delivery.

            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">14.4.1 Shipments from China — Importation and Tariff Acknowledgment</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              By placing an order for goods shipped from China, you acknowledge that this sale is facilitated by merchants outside the U.S., and that you are importing merchandise into the United States for personal, non-commercial use. You further acknowledge that you will be listed as the importer of record for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) purposes and that your order will be imported in accordance with all applicable U.S. customs regulations. Revetir is not responsible for shipments delayed or packages opened due to standard customs inspections, which have increased considerably for all international shipments under the Trump administration.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Your order constitutes your agreement to authorize Revetir to appoint a designated carrier or customs broker as your unpaid agent for customs purposes, and to execute a power of attorney on your behalf applicable to a single non-commercial shipment. This authorization includes the execution of the following declaration, as required by CBP:
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4 italic">
              "The designated carrier/customs broker is hereby authorized to execute, as an unpaid agent who has knowledge of the facts, pursuant to the provisions of section 485(f), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, the consignee's and owner's declarations provided for in section 485(a) and (d), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and to enter on my behalf or for my account the goods described in the attached invoice which contains a true and complete statement of the facts concerning the shipment."
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              This authorization permits the designated carrier/customs broker to file on your behalf:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 ml-4 mb-4">
              <li>an administrative entry under Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930, if eligible;</li>
              <li>an informal entry under Section 143.21 of the Customs Regulations, if eligible; or</li>
              <li>a formal customs entry, if required due to shipment value (over $2,500) or applicable trade measures.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for any U.S. duties, taxes, or additional tariffs imposed by law, including but not limited to Section 301 tariffs currently applicable to goods of Chinese origin. These tariffs may apply even if the shipment otherwise qualifies for Section 321 treatment, as the U.S. government imposes additional duties on certain Chinese-made goods regardless of shipment value.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              While many shipments valued under US$800 may qualify for duty- and tax-free importation under Section 321, certain restrictions apply:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 ml-4 mb-4">
              <li>A single order over US$800 may not be split into multiple shipments to avoid duties.</li>
              <li>Orders consolidated under a single bill of lading (B/L) or air waybill (AWB) and sent to the same individual will be treated as one shipment.</li>
              <li>Multiple B/Ls or AWBs to the same recipient on the same day may also be treated as a single shipment, subject to the total combined value.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              <strong>Important Note on Chinese-Origin Goods:</strong> U.S. Customs and Border Protection may apply additional scrutiny to shipments from China, and shipments containing goods subject to Section 301 tariffs may not qualify for duty exemption under Section 321, even if the total value is under $800. Revetir and its carriers will make reasonable efforts to identify and apply the correct import procedures, but ultimate responsibility for any duties, taxes, or delays rests with you as the importer.

              To give us an opportunity to informally resolve any disputes, claim or controversy between you and us arising out of or relating to your use of the Services and these Terms, including our U.S. Privacy Policy ("Disputes"), you agree to first communicate your Dispute to us at care@revetir.com. Most concerns can be quickly resolved in this manner, and you agree not to bring any lawsuit or to initiate arbitration proceedings until 60 days after the date on which you communicated your Dispute to customer care have elapsed. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle your Dispute directly through consultation and good faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. If we are unable to resolve your Dispute within 60 days, you may seek relief through arbitration or in small claims court as set forth below. Any action to enjoin the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's intellectual property rights shall not be subject to the requirements of this Initial Dispute Resolution paragraph.

              If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution pursuant to the procedures outlined in the paragraph above, you and Revetir each agree that any Dispute will be settled by binding arbitration, except that you and Revetir each retain the right to bring an individual action in small claims court, the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of the party's respective intellectual property rights, and the right to seek public injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction. Any such small claims matter shall be brought in the state courts of the State of California or the United States District Court for the Central District of California, and you consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in such courts.

              The arbitrator shall exclusively determine all issues as to the Dispute. The arbitrator shall also determine any question as to whether any Dispute or issue is subject to arbitration, and the enforceability or interpretation of this Dispute Resolution Section.

Under no circumstances will you file, seek, or participate in a class action, mass action, or representative action in connection with a Dispute. Further, unless both you and Revetir otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section will be deemed void.

              The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this Dispute Resolution section. (The AAA Rules are available www.adr.org) If for any reason, AAA is unable or unwilling to conduct the arbitration consistent with this Agreement, you and Revetir will pick another arbitrator pursuant to 9 U.S. Code § 5.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">22.6 Arbitration Procedure and Location.</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              If the value of the Dispute does not exceed 10,000 United States Dollars ("USD"), then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Revetir submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary, in which case, such hearing shall be conducted by telephone, unless you and Revetir agree otherwise. If the value of the Dispute exceeds 10,000 USD, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Any in-person arbitration hearing shall be conducted in Los Angeles County, California unless you and Revetir agree otherwise. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration.

              The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator bases any award. Any award in arbitration shall determine the rights and obligations between the named parties only. The arbitrator may grant any remedy, relief, or outcome that the parties could have received in court, including awards of attorney's fees and costs, in accordance with the law(s) that applies to the case, except that the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
