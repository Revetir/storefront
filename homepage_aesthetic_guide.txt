Layout & Composition

Structure the page as if it were a living editorial spread rather than a UI. Use a wide asymmetrical grid with invisible rails that allow modules to “breathe” more than they align. Anchor the primary headline left, oversized, and allowed to wrap awkwardly if necessary — the tension is intentional. Interleave large visual fields with text blocks that feel curated rather than stacked: alternate full-bleed imagery, fragmented image cards, and quiet text zones that interrupt expectation. Introduce one dominant background plane (it may be neutral or boldly colored), and treat the foreground as layered objects floating upon it. Avoid a rigid top-down page hierarchy; instead, create a narrative sequence of sections that reveal rather than present. Let navigation recede into minimal typographic elements so the content carries the visual weight. Movement should be subtle: slow crossfades, parallax shifts, text that gently advances into space rather than snapping. The page should behave as a gallery that happens to be interactive.

Density & Whitespace

Use whitespace as a structural material, not decoration. Maintain long horizontal breaths between major sections and unexpected vertical gaps inside sections to create rhythm. Permit empty fields that feel intentional — as if they are holding space for thought. Balance this with moments of deliberate compression: dense text clusters or stacked captions that briefly accelerate the reading tempo before releasing back into openness. Keep copy blocks short but not shallow, and avoid ornamentation that explains what spacing should already communicate. Establish a consistent micro-grid for text (baseline rhythm, constrained line length), while allowing macro-spacing to break symmetry. The result should feel sparse at first glance but richly layered upon closer inspection — a page that resists scrolling quickly, rewarding pause.

Narrative & Emotional Intent

Design as if the homepage is a thesis, not a menu. The first screen should declare an idea rather than a product: something reflective, ambiguous, or poetic that sets emotional context. Let imagery operate as mood — abstract, textural, or experiential — while text gives quiet clarity in the margins. Avoid didactic storytelling; let the visitor infer meaning by moving through fragments that accumulate into coherence. Make the site feel archival and contemporary at once: trustworthy, but willing to experiment; contemplative, but not static. The emotional arc should begin with intrigue, deepen into understanding, and end with a sense that the brand (or institution, or project) participates in culture rather than merely advertising within it. The page should feel like standing in front of a work and being invited to interpret it — guided, but not controlled.
